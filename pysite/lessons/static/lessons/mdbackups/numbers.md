----------
#### Integers

Ints are integers, any whole number. You can perform basic arithmetic
with them as follows

----------
#### Operators

* \+  addition          
* \-  subtraction       
* \*  multiplication    
* /  float division    
* // integer division  
* %  modulo(remainder) 
* \*\* exponent          

```python
>>> 1 + 2
3
>>> 2 - 1
1
>>> 3 * 3
9
```

Here things go a little different. In python you have both integer and 
float division, try both of these

```python
>>> 9 / 2
4.5
```

----------
#### floats

floats are the devil, don't use them, they're unreliable after a certain number of decimals

bits, bytes, data storage, I love python.

```python
>>> 9 // 2 
4
```

There's also the modulo operator which returns the remainder from a 
division operation.

```python
>>> 9 % 2
1
```
