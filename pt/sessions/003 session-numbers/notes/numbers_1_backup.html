<pre># int

Ints are integers, any whole number. You can perform basic arithmetic
with them as follows


## Operators

* +
* -
* *
* /
* //
* %
* **

1 + 2
2 - 1
3 * 3

Here things go a little different. In python you have both integer and 
float division, try both of these

9 / 2

## floats

floats are the devil, don't use them, they're unreliable after a certain number of decimals

bits, bytes, data storage, I love python.

9 // 2

There's also the modulo operator which returns the remainder from a 
division operation.

5 % 2

* sqrt and **0.5
* round
* math.ceil
* math.floor
* abs
* math.pi
* numpy, random, math
